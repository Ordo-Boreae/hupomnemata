## \[3 Jan\] Patients with Severe or Acute Illnesses in Xi'an Died of Delayed Hospital Admission Due to Draconian COVID-19 Restrictions
<img align="right" width="25%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ordo-Boreae/hupomnemata/main/_images/2022-01/20220103GMT123413_%E8%A5%BF%E5%AE%89%E6%95%91%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%81.webp">

A Xi'an citizen shared her story of losing her father due to draconian COVID-19 restrictions on _Xiaohongshu_, a social media and e-commerce platform in mainland China, under the username ‘Taiyanghuahuahua’ (Chinese: 太阳花花花; ‘Tai’ for abbreviation).

Tai first published a post with the title _‘Xi'an! Help!’_ (Chinese: 西安救命！) in the afternoon of Sunday, 2 January 2022, crying for help for her father, who was then suffering a heart attack, to be admitted to Xi'an (Gaoxin) International Medical Centre Hospital (Chinese: 西安高新国际医学中心医院). She claimed that they had presented all the documents required (mainly the PCR test certificates) due to COVID-19 restrictions, and yet the hospital kept refusing to admit her father, citing that they had come from an area of medium-high COVID-19 transmission risk.

According to Tai, her father was finally admitted and received emergency treatment at a quarter to 11 in the evening, eight hours later than their arrival. By then the condition of her father had severely deteriorated, and the treatment failed eventually. Her father passed away roughly two hours later, at around 1 o’clock the next day (3 Jan).<sup>[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/ruqeho/)</sup>

To add to her torments, Tai was not allowed to see her father at the very last moment.<sup>[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/ruv752/)</sup> The security guards of the hospital claimed that her request to see her father was a moral kidnapping, and Tai was further abused by some on the internet, criticising her for using her story to besmirch Xi'an’s fame.

Tai’s posts on _Xiaohongshu_ were soon deleted<sup>[3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ordo-Boreae/hupomnemata/main/_images/2022-01/20220103GMT134805_%E8%A5%BF%E5%AE%89%E6%95%91%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%81-%E7%84%A1%E6%B3%95%E5%B1%95%E7%A4%BA.webp)</sup>.

Similar cases were reported in the comments area of Tai’s posts (before they vanished), including one claiming their granny passed away in a coma without any treatment<sup>[4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ordo-Boreae/hupomnemata/main/_images/2022-01/20220103GMT134503_%E8%A5%BF%E5%AE%89%E6%95%91%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%81-%E5%A7%A5%E5%A7%A5%E5%8E%BB%E4%B8%96.webp)</sup> and another one saying their aunt suffered from a haemorrhage followed by a miscarriage<sup>[5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ordo-Boreae/hupomnemata/main/_images/2022-01/20220103GMT135919_%E8%A5%BF%E5%AE%89%E6%95%91%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%81%E5%B0%8F%E5%A7%A8%E6%B5%81%E7%94%A2.webp)</sup>. Also, in a WeChat group chat, one claimed that a child with acute leukaemia was denied admission by many hospitals because they live in Yanta District.<sup>[6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ordo-Boreae/hupomnemata/main/_images/2022-01/20220103GMT182316_%E8%A5%BF%E5%AE%89%E6%95%91%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%81-%E5%AD%A9%E5%AD%90%E7%99%BD%E8%A1%80%E7%97%85.webp)</sup>

On 6 January, *Dahebao* (Chinese: 大河报) reported another similar case that happened on Friday, 31 December 2021 that a 39-year-old man died of aortic dissection after being consecutively refused to admit by three hospitals in 4 hours.<sup>[7](https://www.sohu.com/a/514807646_121293261)</sup>

## \[4 Jan\] Nearly 40 Thousand (Official Number) in Xi'an were Transferred to Somewhere for ‘Centralised Quarantine’; Videos Show that Some of the Isolation Sites Have Extremely Harsh Living Conditions

According to the official mouthpiece’s report<sup>[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/rv93mp/)</sup>, by the afternoon of 3 January, 39,473 people were sent to some ‘isolation sites’ for ‘centralised quarantine’. Yet some videos showed that some of the isolation sites have extremely harsh conditions<sup>[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/chonglangTV/comments/rvkvtt/)</sup>; some people were even relocated to a tunnel<sup>[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/chonglangTV/comments/rvqipf/)</sup> or a collective garage underground<sup>[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/chonglangTV/comments/rwflvx/)</sup>. One video showed a group of women knelt and begged not to be sent too far to the rural areas since they were with babies.<sup>[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLTV/comments/rug8bc/)</sup> Another source claimed that detention centres are now used as ‘isolation sites’, too, with 18 people jammed in one cell, using dirty quilts, and all the food they were provided with for the entire day was one bucket of instant noodles per capita.<sup>[6](https://www.reddit.com/r/chonglangTV/comments/rw0uzw/)</sup>

A Twitter celebrity Fang Zhouzi (@fangshimin) posted videos of Xi'an, oppugning the sudden mass transferring approach carried out by the local officials, claiming that such mass crowding could only increase the number of the infected, and the chaos they created (many citizens were ordered to withdraw from their home at midnight, and little time were given to pack) had resulted in severe humanitarian issues: some were left on the streets with no place to stay, and many had reported no food were given while isolation.<sup>[7](https://www.reddit.com/r/chonglangTV/comments/rumin5/)</sup>

## \[5 Jan\] Xi'an Citizens were Publicly Rebuked, Beaten, Fined or Detained for Leaving Their Homes due to Hunger (A Review of Recent News)

Xi'an citizens were put under a strict lockdown decree of mandatory ‘staying at home’, ordered by the government since another round of COVID-19 infection broke out in the middle of December. They were not allowed to leave their homes; the government officials even welded the bolts of the gates of the residents’ houses in rural areas<sup>[01](https://www.reddit.com/r/chonglangTV/comments/rvt6xp/)</sup>. And yet food supplies were much delayed and often offered with outrageous prices (some were five to ten times higher than usual, with the absurd branding of ‘Heroic Veggies’), resulting in some being left to starve.<sup>[02](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/rudba8/), [03](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLTV/comments/rumz83/), [04](https://www.reddit.com/r/TimedNews/comments/rwilwy/), [05](https://www.reddit.com/r/LIHKG/comments/rtnkyy/)</sup> Some with the guts to sneak out were beaten and cursed of ‘seeking death’ (1 Jan)<sup>[06](https://www.sohu.com/a/513841523_120083964)</sup>, knelt on the neck (29 Dec)<sup>[07](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/rra31s/)</sup> or publicly rebuked and forced to make a videotaped repentance (4 Jan)<sup>[08](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/rviaje/)</sup> if caught by the so-called ‘volunteers’.

Back at the beginning of the lockdown (late December 2021), some who tried but failed (which resulted in fine or detention) to leave Xi'an on foot, by swimming or cycling, were mocked on the internet as the athletes of the Xi'an Triathlon.<sup>[09](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:I5ezRRVp2XIJ:https://www.163.com/dy/article/GSPU0R0G0516C4TM.html%3Ff%3Dpost2020_dy_recommends), [10](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/rr794z/)</sup>

Students in Xi'an’s universities were under similar situations, being locked in the dormitories with even a deficiency in water supply, let alone food.<sup>[11](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/rqy6et/)</sup>

More to add to this absurdity, many citizens in various residential quarters were ordered to sing ‘patriotic songs’ collectively to praise the CCP government<sup>[12](https://www.bannedbook.org/bnews/cbnews/20220102/1673976.html)</sup>; some were even recorded to be kneeling down and kowtowing to show their gratitude towards the government<sup>[13](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/rtz2rr/)</sup>.

## \[14 Jan\] Chinese Citizens Facing More Stringent Requirements in Acquiring Passports

A _Douban_ thread has revealed that tighter restrictions were imposed on the issuance of passports. One tried but failed to apply for their passport on the grounds of taking the _Test de connaissance du français_ (TCF). The local Bureau of Exit and Entry Administration asked for proof of past experience of learning French and a record of their past social security history.

One day later, when the very person phoned the BEEA for further queries, the clerk on the other end even questioned the eager applicant in an interrogation-like form, asking them where did they find out this approach and who told them to use this method. They were even asked to provide a print-out chat history between them and their friend who introduced this approach.
