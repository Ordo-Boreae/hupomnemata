A Xi'an citizen shared her story of losing her father due to draconian COVID-19 restrictions on _Xiaohongshu_, a social media and e-commerce platform in mainland China, under the username ‘Taiyanghuahuahua’ (Chinese: 太阳花花花; ‘Tai’ for abbreviation).

Tai first published a post with the title _‘Xi'an! Help!’_ (Chinese: 西安救命！) in the afternoon of Sunday, 2 January 2022, crying for help for her father, who was then suffering a heart attack, to be admitted to Xi'an (Gaoxin) International Medical Centre Hospital (Chinese: 西安高新国际医学中心医院). She claimed that they had presented all the documents required (mainly the PCR test certificates) due to COVID-19 restrictions, and yet the hospital kept refusing to admit her father, citing that they had come from an area of medium-high COVID-19 transmission risk.

According to Tai, her father was finally admitted and received emergency treatment at a quarter to 11 in the evening, eight hours later than their arrival. By then the condition of her father had severely deteriorated, and the treatment failed eventually. Her father passed away roughly two hours later, at around 1 o’clock the next day (3 Jan).<sup>[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/ruqeho/)</sup>

To add to her torments, Tai was not allowed to see her father at the very last moment.<sup>[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/ruv752/)</sup> The security guards of the hospital claimed that her request to see her father was a moral kidnapping, and Tai was further abused by some on the internet, criticising her for using her story to besmirch Xi'an’s fame.

Tai’s posts on _Xiaohongshu_ were soon deleted<sup>[3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ordo-Boreae/hupomnemata/main/_images/2022-01/20220103GMT134805_%E8%A5%BF%E5%AE%89%E6%95%91%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%81-%E7%84%A1%E6%B3%95%E5%B1%95%E7%A4%BA.webp)</sup>.

Similar cases were reported in the comments area of Tai’s posts (before they vanished), including one claiming their granny passed away in a coma without any treatment<sup>[4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ordo-Boreae/hupomnemata/main/_images/2022-01/20220103GMT134503_%E8%A5%BF%E5%AE%89%E6%95%91%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%81-%E5%A7%A5%E5%A7%A5%E5%8E%BB%E4%B8%96.webp)</sup> and another one saying their aunt suffered from a haemorrhage followed by a miscarriage<sup>[5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ordo-Boreae/hupomnemata/main/_images/2022-01/20220103GMT135919_%E8%A5%BF%E5%AE%89%E6%95%91%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%81%E5%B0%8F%E5%A7%A8%E6%B5%81%E7%94%A2.webp)</sup>.
