## \[3 Jan\] Patients with Severe or Acute Illnesses in Xi'an Died of Delayed Hospital Admission Due to Draconian COVID-19 Restrictions
<img align="right" width="25%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ordo-Boreae/hupomnemata/main/_images/2022-01/20220103GMT123413_%E8%A5%BF%E5%AE%89%E6%95%91%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%81.webp">

A Xi'an citizen shared her story of losing her father due to draconian COVID-19 restrictions on _Xiaohongshu_, a social media and e-commerce platform in mainland China, under the username ‘Taiyanghuahuahua’ (Chinese: 太阳花花花; ‘Tai’ for abbreviation).

Tai first published a post with the title _‘Xi'an! Help!’_ (Chinese: 西安救命！) in the afternoon of Sunday, 2 January 2022, crying for help for her father, who was then suffering a heart attack, to be admitted to Xi'an (Gaoxin) International Medical Centre Hospital (Chinese: 西安高新国际医学中心医院). She claimed that they had presented all the documents required (mainly the PCR test certificates) due to COVID-19 restrictions, and yet the hospital kept refusing to admit her father, citing that they had come from an area of medium-high COVID-19 transmission risk.

According to Tai, her father was finally admitted and received emergency treatment at a quarter to 11 in the evening, eight hours later than their arrival. By then the condition of her father had severely deteriorated, and the treatment failed eventually. Her father passed away roughly two hours later, at around 1 o’clock the next day (3 Jan).<sup>[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/ruqeho/)</sup>

To add to her torments, Tai was not allowed to see her father at the very last moment.<sup>[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/ruv752/)</sup> The security guards of the hospital claimed that her request to see her father was a moral kidnapping, and Tai was further abused by some on the internet, criticising her for using her story to besmirch Xi'an’s fame.

Tai’s posts on _Xiaohongshu_ were soon deleted<sup>[3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ordo-Boreae/hupomnemata/main/_images/2022-01/20220103GMT134805_%E8%A5%BF%E5%AE%89%E6%95%91%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%81-%E7%84%A1%E6%B3%95%E5%B1%95%E7%A4%BA.webp)</sup>.

Similar cases were reported in the comments area of Tai’s posts (before they vanished), including one claiming their granny passed away in a coma without any treatment<sup>[4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ordo-Boreae/hupomnemata/main/_images/2022-01/20220103GMT134503_%E8%A5%BF%E5%AE%89%E6%95%91%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%81-%E5%A7%A5%E5%A7%A5%E5%8E%BB%E4%B8%96.webp)</sup> and another one saying their aunt suffered from a haemorrhage followed by a miscarriage<sup>[5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ordo-Boreae/hupomnemata/main/_images/2022-01/20220103GMT135919_%E8%A5%BF%E5%AE%89%E6%95%91%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%81%E5%B0%8F%E5%A7%A8%E6%B5%81%E7%94%A2.webp)</sup>.

## \[4 Jan\] Nearly 40 Thousand (Official Number) in Xi'an were Transferred to Somewhere for ‘Centralised Quarantine’; Videos Show that Some of the Isolation Sites Have Extremely Harsh Living Conditions

According to the official mouthpiece’s report<sup>[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/rv93mp/)</sup>, by the afternoon of 3 January, 39,473 people were sent to some ‘isolation sites’ for ‘centralised quarantine’. Yet some videos showed that some of the isolation sites have extremely harsh conditions<sup>[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/chonglangTV/comments/rvkvtt/)</sup>; some people were even relocated to a tunnel<sup>[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/chonglangTV/comments/rvqipf/)</sup>. One video showed a group of women knelt and begged not to be sent too far to the rural areas since they were with babies.<sup>[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLTV/comments/rug8bc/)</sup> Another source claimed that detention centres are now used as ‘isolation sites’, too, with 18 people jammed in one cell, using dirty quilts, and all the food they were provided with for the entire day was one bucket of instant noodles per capita.<sup>[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/chonglangTV/comments/rw0uzw/)</sup>

A Twitter celebrity Fang Zhouzi (@fangshimin) posted videos of Xi'an, oppugning the sudden mass transferring approach carried out by the local officials, claiming that such mass crowding could only increase the number of the infected, and the chaos they created (many citizens were ordered to withdraw from their home at midnight, and little time were given to pack) had resulted in severe humanitarian issues: some were left on the streets with no place to stay, and many had reported no food were given while isolation.<sup>[6](https://www.reddit.com/r/chonglangTV/comments/rumin5/)</sup>
