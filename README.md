# ‘Put on Record’

**Hupomnemata** _(Ὑπομνήματα)_ is a project of **Ordo Boreae** _(Τάγμα του Βορέα)_ that aimed to keep a record of the farcical and yet sometimes tragic things happening in the enchanted soil of mainland China.

This project is in the hope to serve as a reference book for future people to look back and reflect on this utterly miserable ‘new era’.
