**THE MOST IMPORTANT NOTICE**: We recommend you use a separate anonymous profile to commit to this project if you are a citizen of mainland China (no matter if you have left there or not). It’s the basic safety measure to protect us all.

Anyone who wants to help keep a record of the farcical mainland China is welcomed here.

The founder of this project is quite new to Github, and therefore they may need some help on using it, managing this project and collaborating with other editors.

And please note that we are not Wikipedia editors, and it is not our responsibility to do fact checks or use trusted sources or keep a balanced point of view. Although fact checks are encouraged, we do know that not all the editors have the time and energy to do so. This is simply a project to keep a record of and is aimed to become a reference book for future people who want to find some trivia of our time. We are quite sure that there will be a tremendous amount of books in the future based on this era and reflecting on it, and they will have scientific analysis, more convincing data, as well as more well-founded sources. But that’s not what we are going to do; we are not trying to give a macro perspective, a collective description of this era, but to track the details, the most trivial and individual things.

This project has just been founded, and everything (style, structure, presentation, *etc.*) is subjected to change under discussion with other editors (if there will be).

*The Chinese language is allowed in the Issues and Discussions area. The founder themself is a native speaker of Mandarin and can read and write perfect Chinese both in Simplified variation and Traditional (Taiwan-oriented) variation.*

**British English** (*i.e.*  ‘UN English’, ‘English International’ *de jure*) is preferred in the ‘Code’ section.
