## \[27 Oct\] A Resident Forced to Take Unknown TCM Potions Causing Severe Allergic Reactions Begged but Failed to be Exempt

Residents living in a community called Gaodi Centre (Chinese: 高地中心) were forced to take several medicines three times a day, including some unknown TCM potions, as required by the local ‘COVID-19 prevention and control’ authority. The medicines are reported to have caused at least one of the residents severe allergic reactions.

According to a resident, the side effects caused by the potions were so severe that they could only be slightly alleviated by anti-allergic medicines. The suffering resident then begged in a WeChat group of the community to be exempt from this collective medication practice, only to be told by the manager that she must be obedient and carry on taking these medicines. The manager even told the resident that the community could drive her to the hospital if she becomes seriously ill, but the medication must continue.

The community manager then reinforced in the chat group that everyone in the community must continue to follow the medication timetable, including taking the unknown TCM potion; only those who have cancer, are pregnant or are under 14 years old can be exempt. According to the screenshots, these medicines (including the unknown TCM potion) are required to be taken in front of the community’s medical staff. Videos of the process of residents taking the medicines are also required to be recorded and archived.
